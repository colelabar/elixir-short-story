# ShortStoryApp

This is a short-story app built using Elixir and Phoenix, in conjunction with the Programming Phoenix book. This simple app allows users to write posts in a continuous-feed style, in that any new posts show up directly on the home feed. It follows the basic CRUD themes.

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
